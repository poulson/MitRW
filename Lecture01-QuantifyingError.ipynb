      "### Measuring the size of a list of numbers\n",
      "In order to have a precise way of discussing the quality of an approximation or fit of a dataset, it is useful to first decide on a small set of relevant descriptions of the **size** of a list of numbers, with the idea being that we can use these notions of size to quantify the deviation of an approximation from the original data. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the simplest case of a list that consists of a single number, say $\\chi$, high-school algebra would make use of the **absolute value** of $\\chi$, or $| \\chi |$, which we recall is equal to either $\\chi$ or $-\\chi$ (with the choice avoiding a negative result). For example, $|-7|=7$ and $|3|=3$, and so we might say that the **magnitude** of $-7$ is larger than the magnitude of $3$, despite the fact that $-7$ is less than $3$. Equipped with this way of measuring size, we could only conclude that $10$ is closer to $8$ than it is to $13$, as $|10-8|=2$ is less than $|10-13|=3$.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how should we go about precisely describing the sizes of lists of numbers? For example, which list of four numbers is larger, $(2,-2,2,-2)$, $(2,-2,0,3)$, or $(0,0,0,4)$? Until we can decide how to answer this type of question, we have no hope of comparing the sizes of the error from different approximations to a dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three intuitive definitions suggested by students in the class (thankfully!) corresponded to three most common choices for describing the size, or length, of a list of numbers $x$ (with $x(i)$ denoting the $i$'th entry of $x$):\n",

While the $\\| \\cdot \\|$ notation may be awkward, it is the standard mathematical way of denoting the size of an object; in particular, mathematicians would call the above definitions **norms** of **vectors**, and the common names are respectively the **one-norm**, **two-norm**, and **infinity-norm** for the reason that they can be thought of as special cases of the **$p$-norm**\n",

This turns out to imply that, if we ever look for the \"best\" fit for a dataset, the answer can vary drastically depending upon how we measure the size of the error. With that said, for both computational and historical reasons, the two-norm is by far the most common default, though it is worth mentioning in passing that modern statistics frequently involves spending the extra effort to use the one-norm due to the fact that it often produces more meaningful answers."

Similarly, if we were to slightly decrease $\\alpha$ from the median, we would see the last three entries increase at the same rate as the first two entries decrease, which would again produce a worse estimate than the median."
