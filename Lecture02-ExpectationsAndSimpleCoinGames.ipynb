      "### Review of \"norms\" and the resulting \"best approximations\"\n",
      "In the last set of notes, we discussed three different ways of measuring the size of a list of numbers and called each of these different types of measurements a **norm**. We also introduced the terminology **vector** as an alternative to \"list of numbers\", as it is the name used in both physics courses and by mathematicians (though, in the former case it is accompanied with a physical interpretation, and in the latter case a precise definition).\n",

      "$$\n",

      "$$ \\| x \\|_p = \\left( \\sum_i |x(i)|^p \\right)^{1/p}. $$\n",
      "\n",
      "We then showed that, if we want to define the closest single number, say $\\alpha$, to the entire vector $x$, then we might have three different choices of $\\alpha$ depending upon whether we want to make the approximation error, $x - \\alpha$, as small as possible in either the one-norm, two-norm or infinity-norm. We then argued that minimizing the **one-norm** of the error leads to setting $\\alpha$ to the **median** of $x$, minimizing the **two-norm** leads to setting $\\alpha$ to the **mean** of $x$, and minimizing the **max-norm** leads to setting $\\alpha$ to the **center** of $x$.\n",
      "   \n",
      "For the rest of these notes, we will follow the usual convention of minimizing error in the **two-norm**, which leads to the conclusion that the \"best\" approximation of a list of numbers is its **mean**. We will now discuss how this mean takes on a useful interpretation when deciding what one should expect the result of a random event to be."
